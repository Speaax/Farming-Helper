# Farming helper
Disclaimer: I have no clue what Im doing. This code is made mostly with chatgpt 4 and a noob trying to puzzle it together :d
This is not a finished plugin, and I made it mostly for me and some friends.
Currently the plugin works for how I personally like to do my farm runs, but it might not be plesent or even useable for you. If you have any suggestions feel free to leave them on github and I might be able to update it.


Features:
- Required item overlay
- Checks Tool Leprechaun storage for compost when it checks what items are needed
- When you need runes for teleports, both Rune pouch and combination runes will work

- Highlights for patches, items, click options, portal nexus and more to help you with farm runs.
- Different color options for left click, right click and use actions

- Change config for customizable runs and update item requirements automatically (for now it's a limited amount of teleport options available)

Known bugs: Using Mounted xerics as a teleport option fails to highlight the Flower patch and skips it.

Features that I might work on later:
- Bank sorting based on item requirements
- Implement "shortest path" highlights to make longer runs more braindead
- New UI to make changes to config easier
- More teleport options like spirit trees and fairy rings
- Support for Lunar/Arceuus spellbook for Fertile Soil/Ressurect Crops
